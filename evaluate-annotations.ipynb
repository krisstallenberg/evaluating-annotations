      "**Question 1: Is the phrase in square brackets an understatement?**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Analyzing \"[The troubles] began quietly, long before she was conscious of them,\" we see it describes \"troubles\" that presumably escalate into what's referred to as the \"final disaster.\" Describing this escalation as starting \"quietly\" and before the character's awareness tends to minimize the initial perception of these problems. Given that these issues culminate in a \"final disaster,\" labeling their onset as merely \"quiet\" fits the criteria of an understatement. It contrasts sharply with the severity of what it eventually leads to, suggesting the consequences are much more significant than the phrase implies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer: Yes, it is an understatement.**\n",

      "**Question 2: On a scale from 1 to 3, how confident are you in your answer to question 1?**\n",

      "  - **Litotes**: Employs double negatives or an understatement by negating its opposite, often subtly enhancing the impression through understatement.\n",
      "  - **Meiosis**: Typically refers to an understatement that diminishes the importance of something frequently using euphemism or a lesser descriptor.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Since the phrase \"began quietly\" minimizes the emerging severity without employing a double negative or negating the opposite, it better fits the definition of meiosis, where the term \"quietly\" significantly plays down the realization and impact of the initially emerging troubles.\n",

      "**Answer: Meiosis.**\n",

      "**Question 4: If you think the phrase in square brackets is an understatement, is the pragmatic function of the understatement mocking, humorous, or tempering?**\n",
