I might have dressed up a little for the evening	In another instance, Mrs. Allen's grand entrance at the annual ball could scarcely be deemed inconspicuous. Adorned in a gown shimmering with scores of finely stitched pearls and a train that swept the floor with regal disdain, she greeted the company with a graceful nod, remarking, "I might have dressed up a little for the evening." The comment on her attire echoed softly amidst the gasps and whispers, as all present marvelled at her splendid visage.	Yes	3 - Confident	Humoristic	Meiosis (a weaker expression)

took a tiny interest	Miss Emma Woodhouse, never one to idle in matters of the heart, took a tiny interest in Mr. Knightley's wellbeing when she learned of his autumn illness. This concern, consistent with her usual flutter of worries, however, did not propel her into any immediate action, as Mr. Knightley was known to be a robust man, hardly ever confined to bed by seasonal ailments.

Sometimes he's not quite the same, but we've done pretty good work.	"So what's happened," I said. My voice was weak. My insides felt as though they were filled with grinding pieces of broken razor blades.  "You're in Zany-Ward No. 104," Dr. Rothberg said.  "I don't believe I quite understand," I said carefully.  "You will," Dr. Rothberg said. "Let's just say for a starter that when a man is bipped and brought here, we try to put him back together again. It's a long painful process. Sometimes he's not quite the same, but we've done pretty good work. We rebuild burned-out circuits. We have to know exactly what you were before you were bipped, and we try to duplicate the pattern. Regeneration is slow and rough. You'll be all right."	Yes	2 - Somewhat confident	Tempering	Litotes (a negation of the opposite)
And probably twice as cursed	As the dust settled, Vern inspected the relic, its surface etched with runes that glowed faintly under the moonlight.

just a few lines	Upon his return, Mr. Ellwood, having penned just a few lines to Miss Amelia, thought to himself rather anxiously if this letter would suffice to communicate his undying affection and infinite yearnings. Indeed, not a single evening had passed since their last encounter at the annual Spring ball, where he had not occupied his mind with visions of her graceful silhouette accented by the moonlit garden, nor allowed his heart to dwell on anything less than her laughter, echoing like a melodious symphony in his ears. 	No	3 - Confident		
less than perfect	The weather on the afternoon of Mr. Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth was, as he noted upon his arrival at her family's estate, less than perfect. Despite the tempest swirling outside, Elizabeth found her own heart in even greater tumult as Mr. Darcy confessed his ardor, which, in her eyes, altered the severity of any storm to mere shadows of inconvenience.

I suppose I am not wholly averse to the idea.	Miss Catherine's reaction to Mr. Dobson's proposal was, to put it mildly, subdued. She merely blinked twice, her countenance as serene as a still pond on a windless day, before responding with a soft, "I suppose I am not wholly averse to the idea." The assembly, however, knew quite well her heart had long been conquered by his charms, and her quiet acceptance belied the jubilation that everyone suspected must be fluttering wildly in her breast.

not too daunting	During his travels abroad, Sir Frederick wrote back to his sister describing the Alps as not too daunting.

was not exactly warm	Sir William Lucas had been knighted ten years ago, and had since carried himself with a dignity bordering on the imperial. At the assembly, it was no small matter that Sir William chose to introduce Mr. Collins to Mr. Darcy, a connection he believed to be advantageous. Observing the encounter, one might say that Mr. Darcy's reception of Mr. Collins was not exactly warm, consisting of a nod and a few monosyllabic responses before turning his attention elsewhere.

some inclement weather	The summer storm that struck Meryton was spoken of for weeks by those who experienced its fury. Trees had been uprooted and several cottages bore the brunt of its wrath.

he seemed rather pleased	Sir Charles had always held a slight affection for Miss Elwood, who resided in the quaint cottage by the village green. The quaintness of Miss Elwood's laughter or how her eyes lit up at the simplest of joys had not gone unnoticed by him. When finally he gathered the courage to declare his feelings, which had been simmering like a tea kettle left too long on the hearth, and she accepted his proposal with a joyous heart, Sir Charles's closest friend noted that he seemed rather pleased.

He seldom appeared really animated	But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. 	No	3 - Confident		
Seeing the fabric of reality bend was interesting, if not a bit unsettling	Amid the swirling sands of Arrakis, the Navigators of the Spacing Guild convened in their sealed sanctuary, a chamber where the air was thick with the pungent spice, melange. Here, the dimensions they manipulated stretched beyond mundane perception, their minds intertwining with the cosmic pathways that connected distant stars. Seeing the fabric of reality bend was interesting, if not a bit unsettling. Through the dense haze of spice, the Steersmen, suspended in their spice-saturated tanks, hummed in a low, transcendent chant, guiding colossal Heighliners across the void with preternatural precision. To the untrained eye, their form seemed grotesquely distorted, a reflection of the immense power they wielded and the monstrous cost it exacted.

Intense light was needed	As mankind learned about the Dragons, so too, apparently, the Dragons learned about mankind. Somehow they flattened their own bulk and came in on extremely flat trajectories very quickly.  Intense light was needed, light of sunlike intensity. This could be provided only by light bombs. Pinlighting came into existence.  Pinlighting consisted of the detonation of ultra-vivid miniature photonuclear bombs, which converted a few ounces of a magnesium isotope into pure visible radiance.

‘Nothing out of order,’	The light flickered over his desk, casting long shadows across the room as he reviewed the documents one last time. ‘Nothing out of order,’ he murmured, though the heaviness in his chest spoke of unvoiced doubts.

somewhat partial to her	It was in the soft blush of spring when Miss Eleanor's heart first entertained the notion of Colonel Harrison's affections being somewhat partial to her. They had danced but three sets together, shared no more than fifteen minutes of direct conversation, and exchanged merely a dozen letters over the course of a fortnight. Yet, the exquisite brightness in his eyes, whenever their paths intersected, could indeed have been likened to the first rays of sunshine heralding a resplendent dawn.	No	2 - Somewhat confident		
slightly larger company	Seeking to cast off the gentle restraint of daily rigours, Miss Elliot expected no grand affair but a modest gathering of close friends and neighbours — a tea party, rather quaint by any measure. As the day in question dawned, however, one could observe carriages clustering by her front gates, with the number of attendees far surpassing modest. Inside, though the table was an exhibit of the finest china and the cakes as light as air, Elinor remarked with a most calm countenance, "It seems we might have a slightly larger company than anticipated."	Yes	3 - Confident	Humoristic	Meiosis (a weaker expression)
not too pleased	At the assembly dance, the room was alight with whispers and discreet exchanges. Mr. Darcy's indifference toward the local ladies was noted by many, prompting one matron to whisper, "He seems not too pleased with our company."

there was a slight stir among the servants	When the clock struck midnight at the Marwood estate, there was a slight stir among the servants, as the old grandfather clock in the hall, known for its sonorous chimes, had struck a tad softer than usual.

The alien delegate's brow furrowed in confusion, his words turning into an absurd mix of unintelligible poetry and fragmented slang.  "Peace... garden... courageous tundra?"

What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?	"Triplets!" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of triplets.  The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three volunteers.  "Do the parents have three volunteers?" said Leora Duncan.  "Last I heard," said Dr. Hitz, "they had one, and were trying to scrape another two up."  (...)  "They just phoned me that your triplets have been born," said Dr. Hitz. "They're all fine, and so is the mother. I'm on my way in to see them now."  "Hooray," said Wehling emptily.  "You don't sound very happy," said Dr. Hitz.  "What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?" said Wehling. He gestured with his hands to symbolize care-free simplicity.

As she walked through the grand foyer, which had witnessed the steps of countless Elmore generations, she couldn't help but comment on the preservation, "It appears not entirely unchanged," though in reality, the changes were utterly superficial—a slight rearrangement of furniture and the addition of a few modern books to the shelves.

It was somewhat peculiar to see the sun rise twice in one day	She walked along the crest of a dune, the sand fine and shifting under her boots, the landscape a rolling sea frozen in time.

There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter	Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.”	No	2 - Somewhat confident

As a matter of fact—"  He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green phial. "I think I know the stuff... Already I've got something coming." The nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation. He rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end. "And it may be, it may be—I shouldn't be surprised—it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice."  "It will be rather a big thing," I hazarded.  "It will be, I think, rather a big thing."

large as was the great hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of savants.	On the 5th of October, at eight p.m., a dense crowd pressed toward the saloons of the Gun Club at No. 21 Union Square. All the members of the association resident in Baltimore attended the invitation of their president. As regards the corresponding members, notices were delivered by hundreds throughout the streets of the city, and, large as was the great hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of savants. They overflowed into the adjoining rooms, down the narrow passages, into the outer courtyards. There they ran against the vulgar herd who pressed up to the doors, each struggling to reach the front ranks, all eager to learn the nature of the important communication of President Barbicane; all pushing, squeezing, crushing with that perfect freedom of action which is so peculiar to the masses when educated in ideas of “self-government.”	Yes	2 - Somewhat confident	Humoristic	Meiosis (a weaker expression)

You forget yourself!'	People were almost exactly alike all over the world, but the attendant of the air-ship, perhaps owing to her exceptional duties, had grown a little out of the common. She had often to address passengers with direct speech, and this had given her a certain roughness and originality of manner. When Vashti swerved away from the sunbeams with a cry, she behaved barbarically – she put out her hand to steady her.  'How dare you!' exclaimed the passenger. 'You forget yourself!'

He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.

While her friends lamented around her, voicing loud disapprovals and calling the match a tragedy of love unreciprocated, Eleanor merely sighed softly and remarked, “It is not the most joyful news.” Although she had harbored a deep, adoring love for Mr. Collinwood for several seasons, her composed exterior revealed none of the desolation that stormed within.

Tony Rossi yawned, stirred a little, then opened his black eyes and sat up quickly. With one motion he tossed the covers back and slid to the warm metal floor.

a little bit magnificent	During an afternoon stroll beside the lake, Mr. Collin's companion spoke admiringly of the manor’s extensive gardens. "The estate is a little bit magnificent, don't you agree?" she remarked breezily, watching a swan glide by.

occasional clumsiness	During the grand ball at Netherfield, Mr. Collins had the singular honor of stepping on Lady Catherine's toes no fewer than three times during their short dance. Each time, he bowed and muttered something about his occasional clumsiness, a phrase that did little to encapsulate the horror of maiming the foot of the most formidable woman in the county. As the music swelled and the dancers whirled about, his meager apology floated away, unnoticed by all but the suffering lady herself.	Yes	3 - Confident	Humoristic	Meiosis (a weaker expression)

"I wish, for my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the universe."  "I suppose," the pale man said, with a slight smile, 'that you scarcely care to have such things about you in the living—in the active state?"  "On the contrary, we are obliged to," said the Bacteriologist. "Here, for instance—" He walked across the room and took up one of several sealed tubes. "Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the actual living disease bacteria." He hesitated. "Bottled cholera, so to speak."	No	2 - Somewhat confident		
The troubles	As for Vashti, her life went peacefully forward until the final disaster. (...) At times a friend was granted Euthanasia, and left his or her room for the homelessness that is beyond all human conception. Vashti did not much mind. After an unsuccessful lecture, she would sometimes ask for Euthanasia herself. But the death-rate was not permitted to exceed the birth-rate, and the Machine had hitherto refused it to her.  The troubles began quietly, long before she was conscious of them.	Yes	1 - Not confident	Tempering	Meiosis (a weaker expression)

A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.
